# mcdatapack
A program that auto generates a minecraft datapack folder tree with some files to get a basic datapack running

I recommend you go to enviorment variables and edit an entry named "Path", add a new entry pointing to the folder the program is stored in.
This is recommended because then you will be able to run the program from anywhere. Really just a quality of life thing you can do.
